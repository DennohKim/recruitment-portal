## Contributing procedure

### Open issues

### Fork the repository (repo)

- If you're not sure, here's how to [fork the repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)

### Set up your local environment (optional)

If you're ready to contribute and create your PR, it will help to set up a local environment so you can see your changes.

1. Set up your development environment

   - install your favorite text editor/IDE
   - install [Nodejs](nodejs.org)

   <br>

2. Clone your fork

If this is your first time forking our repo, this is all you need to do for this step:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:[your_github_handle]/reactdevske-website.git && cd reactdevske-website
```

Make sure you checkout the `develop` branch `git checkout develop`

If you've already forked the repo, you'll want to ensure your fork is configured and that it's up to date. This will save you the headache of potential merge conflicts.

To [configure your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork):

```
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/reactdeveloperske/reactdevske-website.git
```

To [sync your fork with the latest changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork):

```
$ git checkout develop
$ git fetch upstream
$ git merge upstream/develop
```

3. Install dependencies
